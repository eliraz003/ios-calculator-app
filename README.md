### üèó Get Started With The Codebase
> The main scripts you will need to worry about are:
UIViewController
UIControlDelegate
UIInterfaceDelegate
UIKeypadView
UIKeypadButton
UICalculationRowController
UICalculationRow

* The `UIViewController` script handles the main functionality and UI for the app
* The `UIViewController` inherits from the `UIControlDelegate` and `UIInterfaceDelegate` which provide static functionallity so that other parts of the app can call for actions, for example to call the backspace action call `UIViewController.controlDelegate.backspace()`
* Whenever the calculation is changed (pressing backspace, changing unit, adding a number, or changing the operation) the `WRTITE FUNCTION` is called to recalculate the total value
* `UIKeypadView` is the view that renders the keypad, it is self contained and creates a keypad based on the `keypadLabels` dictionary found, you can try changing these to create a new keypad layout
* `UIKeypadButton` is the individual button for the keypad, it can have either a label or icon property to determain what is rendered inside. When clicked it calls a `didPressKeyButton(action: String)` action within the `UIKeypadView` with the ID property passed to the label (determained by the `keypadLabels` dictionary)
* UICalculationRowController controls the calculation part of the app, it has two main properties, `rows:[UICalculationRow]` and `totalRow:UICalculationRow`, with `rows` containing every calculation currenctly inputted, and `totalRow` being the row that shows the user their final calculation.
